			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>Hi there! I'm Jonathan, a powerlifter, chef, and outdoor enthusiast who also enjoys time at home with a good book and family. I have a degree in Mathematics and Computer Science and specialize in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with experience in Node.js, Processing.js, and Git.I've worked as an Account Program Manager and Mathematics Instructor at TestRocker, an Academic Tutor & Counselor at Dan's Music Studio, a Web Developer at Leaf Tech, and a Freelance Developer at UpWork. At Let's Get Ready, I was a Site Director where I led a team of volunteer tutors, developed and operated a tailored SAT curriculum, and monitored student performance.</p>
			<p>Apart from my work and hobbies, I'm also learning SQL, Python, and React frameworks to expand my skills and stay up-to-date with industry trends.</p>
